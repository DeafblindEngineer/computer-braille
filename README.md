### Computer Braille

The default braille table for BRLTTY is North American Braille Computer Code (NABCC). Below is a collection of the most used signs. This is essential to install a Linux Distro with a refreshable braille display. I also find it very useful when working on the terminal.

**NOTE:** The special characters have been arranged as they would be found on a UK (United Kingdom) QWERTY keyboard starting in the top left-hand corner and finishing in th bottom right-hand corner.
